QT Development under MacOSX using fink.


Installation:

Go to the apple home page, download and install the two packages

	- X11 for MacOSX
	- X11 for MacOSX SDK

at http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/

Go to the fink projects homepage, download and install

	- Fink x.y.z Binary Installer	
	
at http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php

Go trough setup instructions and set up your .cshrc file
as described.
If you have already customized your tcsh with a .tcshrc file
it is neccessary to include the .cshrc file in the .tcshrc file
with

	source ~/.cshrc

Add also following line to your .tcshrc file

	setenv DISPLAY :0.0
	
This will enables the QT application to use the X-Server.

Install the qt packages with

	sudo apt-get install qt

and
	
	sudo apt-get install qt-dev
	
The latter is neccessary for the header files.

The library can be configured with qtconfigure.



Development:

Create your projects as described in the QT reference with
qmake -project. In the resulting makefile change following line

	LIBS     = $(SUBLIBS)  -L$(QTDIR)/lib -L/sw/lib  -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lqt -lXext -lX11 -lm -lXt

to

	LIBS     = $(SUBLIBS)  -L$(QTDIR)/lib -L/sw/lib  -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lqt-mt -lXext -lX11 -lm -lXt

as in fink the name of the qt lib is renamed to qt-mt
Compile your project with make as usual.



Execution of your compiled application:

It is neccessary that the X-Server is already up and running and
the environment variable is DISPLAY is set to :0.0 to start your application.
